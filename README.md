# teste_marvelAPI
This is a simple repository design to test marvel's API using python.

The included files contain:
- A simple file with all  keys used for this test;
- A simple wraper for the Marvel API that creates a class with all relevant data (marvel.py);
- A python script design to write the basic html file (main.py);
- A HTML resulting from running this code for Iron Man (my favorite character from Marvel Comics)
